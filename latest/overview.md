# Sunbird Registry and Credentials

Sunbird RC is an open-source software framework for rapidly building electronic
registries, enable atestation capabilities, and build verifiable credentialling
with minimal effort.

Registry is a shared digital infrastructure which enables authorized data
repositories to publish appropriate data and metadata about a user/entity along
with the link to the repository in a digitally signed form. It allows data
owners to provide authorized access to other users/entities in controlled manner
for digital verification and usage.
